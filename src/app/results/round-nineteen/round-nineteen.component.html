      <p class="round-description">Your challenge is to bounce a pen or pencil (of any kind whatsoever!!) into a
        glass/cup (of any kind whatsoever!!) as many times as possible in TWO MINUTES. Everyone gets two minutes. You
        can use any materials you want, including more than one writing utensil and more than one cup. You can practice
        as much as you want. The only strict rule outside of it being two minutes is that you must throw/bounce your
        writing utensil at the surface that your glass/cup is on so that it hits the surface before bouncing into the
        cup.

        This challenge is taken from Minute To Win It which I have been absolutely crushing. I wouldn't really suggest
        watching it, but here's a video of the challenge that I'm taking from.
