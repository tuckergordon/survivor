      <p class="round-description">We put on clothes every day. T-shirts, sweatshirts, coats... But when was the last
        time you had to put 10 on? In this challenge, you are required to put on 10 upper-body garments (please start
        fully clothed already) as fast you can. AND then take them off (please end fully clothed as well). The clothing
        can be t-shirts, sweaters, sweatshirts, tank-tops, coats -- anything that you would wear by itself in public I
        think. If you have questions about an article of clothing, email or text me about it and I'll give you the okay
        or not. The winner of this challenge will again be determined by finding the average of the time it takes for
        each tribe member to put on the 15 articles of clothing. So there's no need for anyone to sit out.</p>
