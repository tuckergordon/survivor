      <p class="round-description">This next challenge is a little throwback. Y'all remember Sporcle? I'm linking you to
        a
        Sporcle quiz that requires you to find all the US states on a map without borders. You are welcome to skip a
        state
        by clicking one of the arrows, but if you mark one wrong, the quiz will end.</p>

      <p class="round-description">This game requires a little honor: I'm requesting that you play no more than three
        times. I know there's not
        really a way for me to check this, so just don't be an asshole and please play fair.</p>

      <p class="round-description">The scoring will once again be an average of the results for each team. If three
        people
        get 20%, two get 50%, and
        one gets 25%, the team score would be 31% (rounded up). No one is required to sit out.</p>
