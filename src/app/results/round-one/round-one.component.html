    <p class="round-description">The challenge is holding your breath for as long as you can. Here's the kicker, once
      everyone sends A VIDEO of you holding your breath for as long as possible, Andrew will add up the times for
      everyone
      and your team score will be the sum of all of the times of your teammates and yourself added together. Make sure
      you do this safely, and also plug your nose so that Andrew can tell that you're not breathing in a sneaky,
      imperceptible way.</p>
