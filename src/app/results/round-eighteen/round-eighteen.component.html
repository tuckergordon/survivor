        You ever heard of Wikipedia? Probably. And you're about to get very familiar. A friend of mine from outside of
        the game (they exist!!!) has chosen two words. You must look up the first word on Wikipedia. Then you must
        navigate to the other word, only by clicking on links within Wikipedia. For example, if my two words were
        "Italy" and "Joe Seibert," I would start on the Wikipedia page for "Italy." Then I might click on "Italian Food"
        in that article, and then "risotto" in the second article, and then "Joe Seibert" would be on that page for how
        much risotto he eats. Once I clicked his name, I would be done.
      </p>
      <p class="round-description">
        I made that example up, but I hope that makes sense. You click on a link in the first article, and then another
        in that article, and so on and so forth, ideally leading you to the second word.
      </p>
      <p class="round-description">
        Your first word, the page you start on: <strong>Wii</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="round-description">
        Your second word, the page you must end on: <strong>Vivaldi</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="round-description">
        the score is going to be the number of clicks/links it takes!!!!! NUMBER of CLICKS/LINKS!!
