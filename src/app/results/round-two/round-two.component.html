      <p class="round-description">In Cyberspace, it's easy to lose control. Forget about your real world surroundings.
        Many Internet residents have to unplug at certain times to ensure they're taking care of their human bodies.
        This
        next challenge will be a practice in the salvation of the corporeal body. How fast can you drink 32 ounces of
        water? Again, the TEAM that gets the LOWEST COMBINED score wins this challenge. Please send a video of this.
        We'll
        have the same pairings as last challenge.</p>

      <p class="round-description">I'd suggest a Nalgene, but if you don't have one, or another vessel that is 32
        ounces, just be careful in ensuring that you're drinking the correct amount. I wouldn't want you going high or
        low.
