        This site is another typing challenge. Zombies approach from the sides of the screen and they gnaw at your
        barricade. If they get through, you lose! To defeat them, type the words on their bodies. If you type the
        letters correctly, the zombie is defeated! You can only defeat the zombie if you are on the same plane as them
        and facing their direction, so don't mess that up. Sometimes you get rewards that can help you -- in order to
        use one, press enter after typing the word that is on it. You get one chance to do this challenge. Please don't
        take more than one chance! Make sure you are on the Hard difficulty and using Hard words -- there's a screen at
        the beginning that will give you an option. You have ONE CHANCE to do this challenge. It's ONE CHANCE! Okay?
        ONE!
