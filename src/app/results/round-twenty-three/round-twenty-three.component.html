        Take a balled up pair of socks and keep it in the air as long as possible... WITH YOUR FEET! (AHHHHH) To stray
        away from timed challenges, the winner of individual immunity will be the person who gets the most kicks on the
        socks before they hit the ground. As soon as the socks touch another surface, your game is over. They are
        allowed to touch other parts of your body, other than your hands, but the only hits that count are with your
        feet. You may try as many times as you want! I think you can pick any socks that you want, but if you've got
        some really big puppies that are an immense advantage, maybe let me be the judge.
